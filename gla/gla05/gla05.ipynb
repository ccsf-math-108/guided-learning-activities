Whether you are participating live or watching the recording of the live meeting, let the Data Ambassador guide you through the following tasks. There will be moments for you to reflect and explore your own ideas as a way to solidify concepts and skills introduced by your instructor. Keep in mind that this is not a graded assignment for MATH 108 by default. If you have any concerns about participation, reach out to your instructor."

    "Hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a chronic medical condition defined as **systolic blood pressure at or above 130 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure at or above 80 mmHg**. As a leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, stroke, kidney failure, and dementia, hypertension affects over 1.3 billion adults globally according to the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/thailand/news/detail/19-09-2023-first-who-report-details-devastating-impact-of-hypertension-and-ways-to-stop-it). Its societal importance stems from its pervasive prevalence, \"silent\" asymptomatic progression, and disproportionate impact on various communities due to socioeconomic and environmental factors. Systematic monitoring through surveys like NHANES enables early detection of population-level trends, evaluation of public health interventions, and identification of health disparities - critical for reducing cardiovascular mortality and containing associated economic burdens. In this activity, you will focus on recreating results from the NCHS Data Brief No. 511 from October 2024 titled [_Hypertension Prevalence, Awareness, Treatment, and Control Among Adults Age 18 and Older: United States, August 2021–August 2023_](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db511.htm)."

More importantly, you saw how large-scale survey data plays a crucial role in public health decision-making.
